AI is being used in IT jobs to replace works but also give job opportunities to people who can train AI. Almost half of all IT departments incorporate AI in their regular work. IT job opportunities shift and change and new opportunities emerge for some workers. Automation was one of the first areas hit by the impact of AI in the IT workspace. AI is trained to automate tasks so employees don't have to do them and overtime it trains itself on more affective ways to do tasks. This is incredible in the computer world.
