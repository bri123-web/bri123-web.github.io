This website touches up on the fears and concerns most people have with AI intruding on the artspace. An example used in the article is that people will no longer go to artists for "concept art" of themselves for a portrait or an avatar, instead they will upload a selfie of themselves into AI and just have it spit out multiple different variations of the theme they gave it.

This website touches on the harm of AI on a larger creative scale. Both articles are stated as opinionated pieces, but still hold much weight in the backlash society has shown towards generative AI in the creative arts space. While this website is opinionated, it dives deeply into the factual life of AI, what it is, and how it works. It explains that AI is not a sentient tool and needs to be fed in order to produce, but it is also training itself in everything it consumes.
